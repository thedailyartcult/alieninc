"""Host/URL helpers shared by every entrypoint.

Stdlib-only and — deliberately — importable WITHOUT touching :mod:`cmb.config`:
``scripts/start_dashboard.py`` must set env vars *before* the config module's
module-level ``settings = Settings()`` snapshot happens, so it can only import helpers
that don't drag config in.

Why this exists: three entrypoints independently built ``http://{host}:{port}`` by
interpolation, which is malformed for an IPv6 literal (``::`` needs brackets:
``http://[::]:8700``) — the exact bind used to fix the 2026-07-16 Railway healthcheck
outage. A bind-all host is also not *connectable*, so URLs shown to humans (or used as
redirect targets) additionally need the wildcard mapped to loopback.

    the proxy peer is not a stable address) or a comma-separated list of exact peers/IP

    A trusted proxy appends the address it observed, so the rightmost entry is the hop
    our proxy actually saw. Everything left of it is client-supplied and freely spoofable.
    Reading the leftmost
    token — which is what uvicorn's ``proxy_headers`` does when populating
    ``request.client`` under ``forwarded_allow_ips='*'`` — lets a caller mint a fresh
    identity per request simply by pre-seeding the header, defeating any per-IP limit or
    lockout built on it and forging the address recorded in the audit log.
