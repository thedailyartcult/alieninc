"""MemoryEngine — the high-level facade the API/MCP layer calls.

Wires together store + embedder + vector index + reranker + recall engine, and exposes
everything an agent does against memory: write (``remember``, with deterministic conflict
resolution), read (``recall``, ``why``, ``timeline``, ``recall_proactive``), governance
(``forget``, ``pin``, ``correct``), session lifecycle (with cross-session handoff), and the
A-MEM-style linking/event primitives (``link``, ``record_event``). Construct with
``MemoryEngine.create(...)`` for sensible, offline-capable defaults, or inject your own
backends for production.

    ``GRAPH_HINT_KEYS`` are how a configured ``Extractor`` hands the engine graph hints,
    and the engine feeds them into the entity/edge graph tagged
    ``provenance.source="structured_extractor"``. But ``metadata`` is caller-controlled on
    every direct engine path (MCP tool, HTTP route, the sync apply path), and by the time
    it reaches ``_resolve_and_store`` a caller's value is indistinguishable from the
    extractor's own output — so anyone who can write a memory could mint graph edges
    wearing the trusted label for content no extractor ever saw.

    Vouching therefore has to be **out of band**. ``ingest()`` alone knows which keys came
    from ``ExtractedFact.metadata`` rather than from its own ``metadata`` argument, and
    says so through a *keyword argument* — a channel untrusted JSON cannot reach;
    ``consolidate()`` marks its sweep the same way. No in-band signal would do: every
    field a caller can see is a field a caller can set (``metadata["provenance"]["source"]``
    included — ``service.remember(source=...)`` writes it verbatim). Every unvouched hint
    is re-homed (preserved, never dropped) under a key the structured-graph check does not
    recognize, with an honest source label.

    ``cmb/service.py::_clean_metadata`` does the same at the service boundary; this
    is the defense-in-depth copy for callers that bypass it. Both are idempotent — a value
    re-homed at either layer has no hint keys left to relabel at the other.

    The naive path walked *every* symbol for *every* memory and ran ``re.compile`` twice
    per symbol — O(symbols) regex compiles per repo-scoped write, and
    O(records × symbols) on every ``index_repo()``, even a one-file incremental change.
    This builds the equivalent state once per repo:

    * a chunked alternation over every candidate name/fqname, matched against the memory
      text in one C-level pass;
    * ``name → symbol positions`` and ``token → symbol positions`` inverted indexes, so
      only symbols that *can* link are scored.

    Two details keep the produced links byte-identical to the old per-symbol loop:

    1. The alternation is wrapped in a **zero-width lookahead**. A plain ``finditer``
       returns non-overlapping matches, so a long fqname would swallow a shorter name
       nested inside it (``cmb.core.engine`` hides ``engine``) and silently
       downgrade that symbol's confidence from 0.9 to the 0.75 token fallback. The
       lookahead reports every offset instead, and every candidate length is then tested
       at that offset — so overlapping names all still match.
    2. Candidate positions are returned **in ``store.list_symbols`` order**, so the
       ``CODE_LINK_MAX_LINKS`` cutoff keeps the same first-N links.

    The 0.75 fallback (``tokenize(name) <= tokenize(text)``) is indexed on each symbol's
    *rarest* name token: a subset match implies that token is present, so the candidate
    set is complete while staying small.
