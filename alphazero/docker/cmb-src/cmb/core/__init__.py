"""CMB core — interfaces, identifiers, schema, and the v2 store.

This package is the architectural backbone for the v2 engine.
Everything in the system is built against the Protocols in ``interfaces`` so that
concrete implementations (vector index, embedder, reranker, graph, LLM) can be
swapped — including Python → Rust hot paths — without rearchitecting.
