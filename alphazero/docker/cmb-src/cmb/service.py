"""MemoryService — transport-agnostic facade over :class:`MemoryEngine`.

This is the layer the MCP server (and any other front end) calls. It deliberately
has **no MCP dependency**, so it runs and unit-tests offline on ``numpy`` alone
(per AGENTS.md §3). Responsibilities:

* resolve human-friendly ``workspace`` / ``repo`` names to scoped IDs;
* **validate and sanitize all untrusted input** before it reaches the store —
  ingested content is untrusted and memory poisoning is an explicit threat.
  Validation lives here so every front end inherits it;
* return plain JSON-serializable dicts.

The companion :mod:`cmb.mcp_server` is a thin binding of these methods to
MCP tools; nothing in this module imports ``mcp``.

    e.g. any self-host that ran ``cmb-server`` (v1) against ``CMB_DB_PATH``

    real production deployment on 2026-07-13: switching the default entrypoint to the

    normally). A missing file or an unreadable one (encrypted via
    ``CMB_DB_KEY``, corrupt, no ``memories`` table at all) is left alone — the
    normal ``Store()`` path handles a fresh install or surfaces the real error.

    Migration is non-destructive: the original file is copied aside to
    ``<name>.v1-backup-<unix-ts><ext>`` *before* anything else happens, the actual
    migration (:func:`scripts.migrate_to_v2.migrate`) reads the untouched original and
    writes a brand-new file, and only a fully-successful migration is atomically
