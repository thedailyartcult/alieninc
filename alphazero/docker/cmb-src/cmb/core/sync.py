"""Cloud sync — convergent, offline-first replication of the memory store.

This is the *engine* half of the sync feature (the paid surface is gated at the
entry points — ``scripts/sync.py``, the MCP tool, the Inspector route — never in
here, so ``core/`` stays Apache-2.0 and license-free per AGENTS.md §3).

Why this is small: v2 already ships the hard primitives. Memory ids are globally
unique ULIDs (``core/ids.py``) minted with 80 bits of CSPRNG randomness, so two
offline devices never collide; ``Store.add_memory`` is an idempotent
``INSERT ... ON CONFLICT(id) DO UPDATE`` that only defaults timestamps when they are
null, so a remote write re-applies verbatim; and validity is bi-temporal, so a
"delete" is a ``valid_to`` we can merge rather than a destructive op. Sync is
therefore a **state-based CRDT** over memory rows, not a bespoke replication log:

* **Identity is global.** A memory's ULID is the same on every device; union by id.
* **Scope is per-device.** ``workspace_id``/``repo_id`` are per-device ULIDs, so we
  reconcile scope *by name* on apply (like ``scripts/migrate_to_v2.py`` re-homes
  rows) — memory identity stays stable, its scope pointers are re-homed locally.
* **Fields merge by a commutative lattice**, so the merged state is identical
  regardless of which device syncs first, and re-applying a bundle is a no-op:
    - ``valid_to`` / ``expired_at``: earliest non-null wins (an invalidation on any
      device invalidates everywhere — never resurrected).
    - ``stability`` / ``access_count`` / ``last_access``: ``max`` (reinforcement is
      monotone; the spacing effect only ever grows stability).
    - ``pinned``: logical OR.
    - descriptive fields (title/content/keywords/…): last-writer-wins under a
      **deterministic total order** — ``(last_access, ingested_at, content-hash)`` —
      so the winner is a function of the data, never of arrival order.

The one honest limitation: without a per-field logical clock (HLC), a rare
*simultaneous in-place edit of the same field on two devices* resolves by that
deterministic order rather than by true causality — it converges (no divergence,
no lost row), it just may pick a well-defined winner a human wouldn't. Corrections
go through ``MemoryEngine.correct`` (a new bi-temporal row, not an edit), so this
only bites raw ``title``/``mtype`` relabels. A follow-up increment adds an HLC.

Untrusted input: a pulled bundle is attacker-controlled (SECURITY.md — memory
poisoning is an explicit threat). ``apply_bundle`` validates and clamps every row,
re-homes it into the caller's own workspace, and never executes bundle content.
