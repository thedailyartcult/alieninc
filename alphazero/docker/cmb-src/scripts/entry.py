"""cmb - the single front door, so the portal's copy-paste command actually runs.

Every capability already ships as its own ``cmb-<verb>`` console script; this adds
the spelling customers are *shown*.  The account portal hands out

    cmb connect --token engr_ct_...

and until there was an ``cmb`` executable that string was not a runnable command.

This is a dispatcher, not a second CLI: it rewrites ``sys.argv`` and calls the same
``main()`` the matching ``cmb-<verb>`` script calls, so a verb behaves identically
either way and there is exactly one implementation of each command.  The import is lazy
so ``cmb connect`` never drags in the memory/embedding stack that ``cmb cli``
needs.
