    Every step lands here, because "bounded" has to mean the same thing for a step that is

    provide it, in two distinct ways:

    * *With* pipes it does not even bound the call. Once the budget expires CPython kills
      the direct child and then drains with an **unbounded** ``communicate()``, which waits
      for every inherited write handle to close — ``git-remote-https`` included.
    * *Without* pipes it returns on time but leaves the descendants running. ``pip``'s
      resolver or a credential helper keeps writing to the environment and the repository
      while the caller has already moved on to a rollback or a retry, which is precisely
      the guarantee the budget is supposed to buy.

    So the child is spawned into its own session (POSIX) and the whole tree is torn down
    with ``taskkill /T`` (Windows) before the pipe is re-read — and that drain is bounded
    too, so a pipe a dead writer still owns cannot re-hang the call.

    Only stdout is ever piped, and only when *capture* asks for it: stderr staying on the
    terminal both surfaces git's own explanation of a failure and leaves one fewer
    inherited write handle for a grandchild to hold open. ``stdin`` is closed for every
