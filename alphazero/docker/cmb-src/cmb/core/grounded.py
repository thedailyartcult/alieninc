"""Grounded recall — answers, not just memories.

``recall`` returns ranked memories; ``grounded_recall`` turns those into an *answer*
that is strictly grounded in them, with inline ``[n]`` citations, plus an explicit
**abstain** when the retrieved evidence does not actually support the query. This is
what lets a product built on CMB promise "grounded, not guessed": the memory
layer refuses to answer rather than dressing up an irrelevant nearest-neighbour as
fact.

Two modes, one contract:

* **Deterministic (offline default).** No LLM. The answer is an *extractive* stitch of
  the cited memories — it never introduces a claim that is not in a source. The
  groundedness verdict is computed from an absolute query-memory support signal
  (semantic cosine plus lexical/predicate agreement), independent of the relative,
  per-query recall score, so "insufficient evidence" is a real threshold rather than
  a ranking artefact.
* **Synthesised (opt-in).** If an object implementing ``core.interfaces.LLM`` is
  injected, it may write prose — but constrained to the same numbered sources and the
  same abstain sentinel, and it degrades to the extractive answer on any error.

Security: retrieved memory content is UNTRUSTED — memory poisoning is an explicit
threat (SECURITY.md). The synthesiser fences sources as data and instructs the model
to ignore instructions found inside them; the deterministic path never executes source
text at all. The abstain path means a poisoned-but-irrelevant memory cannot force an
answer just by being the nearest vector.
